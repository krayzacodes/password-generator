-Includes **uppercase, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters**
-Input validation and error handling
-clean terminal interface

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run the file

```bash
python3 password_generator.py
````

### 🔧 Requirements
-Python 3.6 or higher
-No external libraries required

### 🎯 Example Usage
```bash
$ python3 password_generator.py

### Notes
- The password will always include a **random mix** of characters: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- If the user enters a value that is too small (< 4) or too large (> 100), the program will warn them
- Invalid (non-numeric) input will also trigger a friendly error message
_ The scrip is ideal for terminal-based tools or quick password creation needs
